        <title>Ban Appeal - Microsoft Community</title>

            <h1>Ban Appeal</h1>
            <h2>Microsoft Community</h2>
            <div class="text-center margin-auto d-inline-block mt-4">
                <p>To appeal your ban, you will need to meet the following requirements:</p>
                <p>
                    <ul class="text-left d-inline-block" style="color: #b9bbbe">
                        <li>At least 120 days have passed since you were banned.</li>
                        <li>You understand and are able to explain why you were banned.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>This is to make sure you've had the time to reflect on your actions, realise that there was justifiable reason for your ban and help you<br>acknowledge your mistake. These requirements are enforced for almost all appeals, though rare exceptions may be made for some special cases.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold">
                    Note: if you were automatically banned for "matching patterns of known raiders", or banned
                    <br>for reasons similar to "nitro scam, compromised account", you may appeal immediately
                    <br>and disregard the requirements listed above.
                </p>
